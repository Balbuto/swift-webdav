# Contribution Guide

Please feel welcome to use and contribute to Swift-WebDAV.

The best way to collaborate with the project contributors is through
GitHub: <https://github.com/hpcloud/swift-webdav>.

-   If you want to contribute code by either fixing a problem or
    creating a new feature, please open a [GitHub pull
    request](https://github.com/hpcloud/swift-webdav/pulls).
-   If you want to raise an issue such as a defect or an enhancement
    request please open a [GitHub
    issue](https://github.com/hpcloud/swift-webdav/issues) while
    keeping the following in mind:
    -   Try to reduce your code to the bare minimum required to
        reproduce the issue.
    -   If we can't reproduce the issue, we can't fix it. Please list
        the exact steps required to reproduce the issue. Include
        versions of your OS, Node.js, etc. Include relevant
        logs or sample code.

After a pull request is made, other contributors will offer feedback. If
the patch passes review, a maintainer will accept it with a comment.
